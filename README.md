# MCP Filesystem Server

This is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** implementation that exposes a **local filesystem** as a knowledge base provider.  
It allows MCP clients (like AI assistants) to read files from your system in a controlled manner and use them as context.

## üìÇ Features
- Exposes selected directories as a **knowledge base**.
- Supports **read-only access** to text-based files (e.g., `.md`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx` after parsing).
- Compatible with **MCP-compatible clients**.
- Configurable root directory for safe sandboxing.
